A carrier connects the centers of the two gears and rotates to carry one gear, called the planet gear or planet pinion, around the other, called the sun gear or sun wheel. The planet and sun gears mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip. A point on the pitch circle of the planet gear traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, the sun gear is fixed and the planetary gear(s) roll around the sun gear.\n\nAn epicyclic gear train can be assembled so the planet gear rolls on the inside of the pitch circle of a fixed, outer gear ring, or ring gear, sometimes called an annular gear. In this case, the curve traced by a point on the pitch circle of the planet is a hypocycloid.\n\nThe combination of epicycle gear trains with a planet engaging both a sun gear and a ring gear is called a planetary gear train.[1][2] In this case, the ring gear is usually fixed and the sun gear is driven.","admin_user":{"id":1,"firstname":"Shaun","lastname":"Fields","username":null,"preferedLanguage":null},"Slug":"Planterary-Gearbox","published_at":"2021-10-22T11:36:13.640Z","created_at":"2021-10-22T11:26:39.775Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T07:54:19.709Z","Image":{"id":1,"name":"Planetary-gear.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":650,"height":565,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Planetary-gear.png","hash":"thumbnail_Planetary_gear_bf138a8400","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":179,"height":156,"size":36.51,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Planetary_gear_bf138a8400.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Planetary-gear.png","hash":"small_Planetary_gear_bf138a8400","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":435,"size":215.61,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_Planetary_gear_bf138a8400.png"}},"hash":"Planetary_gear_bf138a8400","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":292.79,"url":"/uploads/Planetary_gear_bf138a8400.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.248Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.295Z"},"sectors":[]},{"id":2,"Title":"Reciprocal pump","Purchase_time":"2021-09-15T10:00:00.000Z","Price":500,"Content":"Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes.[citation needed]\n\nA crank can be used to convert circular motion into reciprocating motion, or conversely turn reciprocating motion into circular motion.\n\nFor example, inside an internal combustion engine (a type of reciprocating engine), the expansion of burning fuel in the cylinders periodically pushes the piston down, which, through the connecting rod, turns the crankshaft. The continuing rotation of the crankshaft drives the piston back up, ready for the next cycle. The piston moves in a reciprocating motion, which is converted into circular motion of the crankshaft, which ultimately propels the vehicle or does other useful work.","admin_user":{"id":2,"firstname":"The","lastname":"Manager","username":null,"preferedLanguage":null},"Slug":"Reciprocal-Pump","published_at":"2021-10-22T11:36:19.662Z","created_at":"2021-10-22T11:31:22.901Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T07:55:46.138Z","Image":{"id":4,"name":"reciprocating-pistol-pump.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":750,"height":750,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_reciprocating-pistol-pump.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_reciprocating_pistol_pump_a3d97e411c","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":156,"height":156,"size":4.57,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_reciprocating_pistol_pump_a3d97e411c.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_reciprocating-pistol-pump.jpg","hash":"small_reciprocating_pistol_pump_a3d97e411c","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":500,"size":27.56,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_reciprocating_pistol_pump_a3d97e411c.jpg"}},"hash":"reciprocating_pistol_pump_a3d97e411c","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":49.16,"url":"/uploads/reciprocating_pistol_pump_a3d97e411c.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.676Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.730Z"},"sectors":[]},{"id":3,"Title":"Gate Valves","Purchase_time":"2021-10-01T10:00:00.000Z","Price":300,"Content":"A gate valve, also known as a sluice valve, is a valve that opens by lifting a barrier (gate) out of the path of the fluid.
