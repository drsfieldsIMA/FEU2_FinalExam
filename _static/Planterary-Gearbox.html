A carrier connects the centers of the two gears and rotates to carry one gear, called the planet gear or planet pinion, around the other, called the sun gear or sun wheel. The planet and sun gears mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip. A point on the pitch circle of the planet gear traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, the sun gear is fixed and the planetary gear(s) roll around the sun gear.\n\nAn epicyclic gear train can be assembled so the planet gear rolls on the inside of the pitch circle of a fixed, outer gear ring, or ring gear, sometimes called an annular gear. In this case, the curve traced by a point on the pitch circle of the planet is a hypocycloid.\n\nThe combination of epicycle gear trains with a planet engaging both a sun gear and a ring gear is called a planetary gear train.[1][2] In this case, the ring gear is usually fixed and the sun gear is driven.","admin_user":{"id":1,"firstname":"Shaun","lastname":"Fields","username":null,"preferedLanguage":null},"Slug":"Planterary-Gearbox","published_at":"2021-10-22T11:36:13.640Z","created_at":"2021-10-22T11:26:39.775Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T07:54:19.709Z","Image":{"id":1,"name":"Planetary-gear.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":650,"height":565,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Planetary-gear.png","hash":"thumbnail_Planetary_gear_bf138a8400","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":179,"height":156,"size":36.51,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Planetary_gear_bf138a8400.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Planetary-gear.png","hash":"small_Planetary_gear_bf138a8400","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":435,"size":215.61,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_Planetary_gear_bf138a8400.png"}},"hash":"Planetary_gear_bf138a8400","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":292.79,"url":"/uploads/Planetary_gear_bf138a8400.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.248Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.295Z"},"sectors":[]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[slug]","query":{"slug":"Planterary-Gearbox"},"buildId":"RmElEbKCzsHErCxAot5JD","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
