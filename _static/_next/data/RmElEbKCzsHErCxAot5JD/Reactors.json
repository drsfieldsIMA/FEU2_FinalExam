This process can either be aerobic or anaerobic. These bioreactors are commonly cylindrical, ranging in size from litres to cubic metres, and are often made of stainless steel.[citation needed] It may also refer to a device or system designed to grow cells or tissues in the context of cell culture.[2] These devices are being developed for use in tissue engineering or biochemical/bioprocess engineering.[citation needed].","admin_user":{"id":1,"firstname":"Shaun","lastname":"Fields","username":null,"preferedLanguage":null},"Slug":"Reactors","published_at":"2021-10-29T12:02:06.080Z","created_at":"2021-10-29T12:02:02.333Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T08:09:34.915Z","Image":{"id":3,"name":"bioreactor.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":750,"height":497,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_bioreactor.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_bioreactor_e854a2197b","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":235,"height":156,"size":8.36,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_bioreactor_e854a2197b.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_bioreactor.jpg","hash":"small_bioreactor_e854a2197b","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":331,"size":27.92,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_bioreactor_e854a2197b.jpg"}},"hash":"bioreactor_e854a2197b","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":54.94,"url":"/uploads/bioreactor_e854a2197b.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.605Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.630Z"},"sectors":[{"id":2,"published_at":"2021-10-30T08:07:02.405Z","created_at":"2021-10-30T08:06:38.711Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T08:07:02.428Z"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
