{"pageProps":{"asset":{"id":3,"Title":"Gate Valves","Purchase_time":"2021-10-01T10:00:00.000Z","Price":300,"Content":"A gate valve, also known as a sluice valve, is a valve that opens by lifting a barrier (gate) out of the path of the fluid. Gate valves require very little space along the pipe axis and hardly restrict the flow of fluid when the gate is fully opened. The gate faces can be parallel but are most commonly wedge-shaped (in order to be able to apply pressure on the sealing surface).","admin_user":{"id":1,"firstname":"Shaun","lastname":"Fields","username":null,"preferedLanguage":null},"Slug":"Gate-Valves","published_at":"2021-10-29T12:00:15.149Z","created_at":"2021-10-29T12:00:12.920Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T08:07:21.830Z","Image":{"id":2,"name":"gate.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":500,"height":500,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_gate.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_gate_1572dfd249","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":156,"height":156,"size":3.13,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_gate_1572dfd249.jpg"}},"hash":"gate_1572dfd249","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":15.51,"url":"/uploads/gate_1572dfd249.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.533Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T07:50:38.553Z"},"sectors":[{"id":2,"published_at":"2021-10-30T08:07:02.405Z","created_at":"2021-10-30T08:06:38.711Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T08:07:02.428Z"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
